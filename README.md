This is a toy app built using [cujojs](http://cujojs.com), and was used during my presentation at Dojoconf 2011.  It's not intended to be a complete example, but shows some interesting aspects of cujojs.

To run the demo:

1. `git clone https://github.com/briancavalier/notes-demo-dojoconf-2011.git` Be sure to clone it into a directory served by a web server
2. `cd notes-demo-dojoconf-2011`
3. `git submodule init && git submodule update`
4. Open index.html in your browser.  Note that a web server is required and `file://` urls won't work
